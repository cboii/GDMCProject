  "settlement_story": "Havenbrook is a snug riverside settlement nestled between rolling hills and dense pines. Five modest timber homes cluster around a cobblestone square, flanked by two stone wells and dotted with lantern-lit decorations\u2014flowerbeds, carved benches, and a small fishing dock. At the hilltop stands a single-stone church whose stained-glass window glints at dawn. Opposite the church, the Silver Stag Inn welcomes weary travelers with a warm hearth and hearty stew. A solitary workshop fills the miscellaneous plot with the gentle clank of hammers at dusk. Though there are no formal farms or town halls, the villagers\u2019 ingenuity sustains them: rooftop gardens, community gatherings at the wells, and craft fairs beneath colorful banners keep life bright and bound by friendship.",
